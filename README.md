Got it 👍 Here’s the **README.md** file for your K-Means Mall Customer Segmentation project:

# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to apply **unsupervised learning** using **K-Means clustering** to segment mall customers based on their demographics and spending behavior.

This segmentation can help businesses design **personalized marketing strategies**, identify **high-value customers**, and improve customer experience.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** → Data manipulation & cleaning
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** → KMeans clustering, PCA, evaluation metrics

---

## 📂 Dataset

**Mall Customers Dataset** contains demographic and spending details of customers.

**Columns:**

* `CustomerID` → Unique identifier
* `Gender` → Male/Female
* `Age` → Age of customer
* `Annual Income (k$)` → Annual income in thousands of dollars
* `Spending Score (1-100)` → Spending score assigned by the mall

---

## 📈 Steps Performed

### 1. Load & Explore Dataset

* Load dataset with Pandas
* Select important features: `Age`, `Annual Income (k$)`, `Spending Score (1-100)`

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Standardized the data using **StandardScaler**

### 3. Find Optimal Number of Clusters

* **Elbow Method** (plot WCSS vs K)
* **Silhouette Score** to evaluate clustering quality

### 4. Apply K-Means Clustering

* Fit KMeans model with chosen `K`
* Assign cluster labels to customers

### 5. Visualization

* **PCA 2D Scatter Plot** for clusters
* **Annual Income vs Spending Score** plot to see customer segments

### 6. Evaluation

* Report **Silhouette Score**
* Analyze business meaning of each cluster

---

## 📊 Example Results

* Customers are grouped into distinct segments such as:

  * **Cluster 1:** High Income, High Spending
  * **Cluster 2:** High Income, Low Spending
  * **Cluster 3:** Low Income, High Spending
  * **Cluster 4:** Low Income, Low Spending
  * **Cluster 5:** Average Income, Moderate Spending

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download files
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python kmeans_customer_segmentation.py
   ```

---

## 📌 Outputs

* **Elbow Plot** → Helps choose best K
* **Silhouette Score** → Measures clustering quality
* **Cluster Visualization** (PCA & Income vs Spending Score plots)

👉 Do you want me to **add cluster profiling tables** (like average age, income, spending per cluster) inside this README so that it looks like a full analytics report?
